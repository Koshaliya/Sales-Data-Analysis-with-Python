# Sales Data Analysis with Python
Conducted exploratory and statistical analysis of Acme Co.â€™s US sales data to identify revenue and profit drivers across products, channels, and regions. 

This project and analysis were inspired by the work of Satyajit Pattnaik (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOPnZclka0o).  
I referred to his approach while exploring the dataset and used it as a guide to structure my own analysis and insights.
